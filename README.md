# Camel Ribbon Adapter (Work In Progress)

Apache Camel is the most popular open source integration framework: http://camel.apache.org  
Ribbon is a popular open source IPC and LB library https://github.com/Netflix/Ribbon

Will blog about this component soon on http://www.ofbizian.com/

Hhhhmmm, seems Ribbon doesn't fit nicely into the Camel routing model.
